Arc Essential is a customized Redpill Loader for DSM 7.x (Xpenology) with enhanced hardwaresupport, addons, guided (semi-automated) installation and more. Multiple customization options are built-in. It is modified to run on different hardware (More informations in wiki).

* Arc and DSM are independent from each other! Arc is a Boothelper for DSM.
* Commercial use is not permitted and strictly forbidden!!!
* DSM and all Parts of it are under Copyright / Ownership by Synology Inc.

* Arc is based on full DSM and not vDSM.
* Any user-specific custom modification of the tested & prebuilt bootloader images could potentially cause irreversible data destruction.
* I'm not responsibly liable for damage or personal loss of any types.
* The project with its affiliation is released for educational and learning purpose only.

* The Loader is free and will be free forever! If you paid for it to an suspicious person, i can't help you. Because i'm not connected to them! I don't want to make money with this Project.
